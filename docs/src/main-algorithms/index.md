# Overview

This section will document the main algorithms available in Semigroups.jl for computing with semigroups and monoids.

## Planned Algorithms

The following algorithms from libsemigroups will be exposed through Semigroups.jl:

### Froidure-Pin Algorithm

### Knuth-Bendix Completion

### Todd-Coxeter Algorithm

### Schreier-Sims Algorithm

## Status

This section is under development. Check back for updates as algorithms are implemented.
