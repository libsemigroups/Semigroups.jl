# Overview

Many of the classes in Semigroups.jl implement algorithms, and hence are
runnable. During the running of these algorithms, it is often desirable to
report the state of the algorithm. Therefore, the classes [`Runner`](@ref) and
Reporter exist to provide common functions to many classes that implement the
main algorithms.
