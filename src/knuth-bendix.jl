    KnuthBendix{W}

Type implementing the Knuth-Bendix completion algorithm for semigroups and
monoids.

A `KnuthBendix` object represents a [string rewriting
system](https://w.wiki/9Re) defining a 1- or 2-sided congruence on a finitely
presented semigroup or monoid. It is constructed from a
[`congruence_kind`](@ref Semigroups.congruence_kind) and a
[`Presentation`](@ref Semigroups.Presentation), and runs the Knuth-Bendix
algorithm to find a confluent rewriting system.

The type parameter `W` is the word type of the congruence; see
[`CongruenceCommon`](@ref Semigroups.CongruenceCommon). It is determined by
the presentation used to construct the `KnuthBendix`.

`KnuthBendix` is a subtype of [`CongruenceCommon`](@ref
Semigroups.CongruenceCommon) (and hence of [`Runner`](@ref Semigroups.Runner)),
so all runner methods (`run!`, `run_for!`, `run_until!`, `finished`,
`timed_out`, `current_state`, etc.) and all common congruence helpers work on
`KnuthBendix` objects.

# Constructors

    KnuthBendix(kind::congruence_kind, p::Presentation) -> KnuthBendix
    KnuthBendix(other::KnuthBendix) -> KnuthBendix

The first form constructs a `KnuthBendix` from a congruence kind and a
presentation. The second form copies an existing `KnuthBendix`.

# Throws

- `LibsemigroupsError` if `p` is not valid.
- `LibsemigroupsError` if `p` has more than 256 letters in its alphabet
  (the internal rewriting trie uses 1-byte letter indices).

# Word types

`KnuthBendix{W}` supports both word types: `W = Vector{Int}` (1-based letter
indices) and `W = String` (ASCII characters). The word type is taken from the
presentation, so `KnuthBendix(twosided, p::Presentation{String})` is a
`KnuthBendix{String}`, and all words passed to or returned from it are
`String`s. Only the `RewriteTrie` rewriter is bound.

# Example

The example below mirrors the [libsemigroups `KnuthBendix`
example](https://libsemigroups.github.io/libsemigroups/group__knuth__bendix__class__group.html)
for the free group on two generators with relations ``ab = ba^{-1}`` and
``cd = dc^{-1}``. Letters `1, 2, 3, 4` correspond to ``a, b, c, d``.

```julia
using Semigroups

p = Presentation()
set_contains_empty_word!(p, true)

add_rule_no_checks!(p, [2, 1], Int[])  # ba = ε
add_rule_no_checks!(p, [3, 4], Int[])  # cd = ε
add_rule_no_checks!(p, [4, 3], Int[])  # dc = ε
