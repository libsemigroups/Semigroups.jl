    Kambites

Type implementing small overlap class, equality, and normal forms for
small overlap monoids -- finitely presented monoids whose presentation
satisfies the small overlap condition `C(n)` for `n >= 4` (Kambites,
2009).

A [`Kambites`](@ref Semigroups.Kambites) instance represents a
congruence on the free monoid or semigroup containing the rules of the
[`Presentation`](@ref Semigroups.Presentation) used to construct the
instance, together with the
[`generating_pairs`](@ref Semigroups.generating_pairs) added via
[`add_generating_pair!`](@ref Semigroups.add_generating_pair!). As such,
generating pairs and presentation rules are interchangeable in the
context of `Kambites` objects.

A `Kambites` object is constructed from a
[`congruence_kind`](@ref Semigroups.congruence_kind) (which must be
[`twosided`](@ref Semigroups.twosided)) and a
[`Presentation`](@ref Semigroups.Presentation), or copied from another
`Kambites`.

`Kambites` is a subtype of
[`CongruenceCommon`](@ref Semigroups.CongruenceCommon) (and hence of
[`Runner`](@ref Semigroups.Runner)), so all runner methods (`run!`,
`run_for!`, `finished`, `timed_out`, etc.) and most common congruence
helpers ([`reduce`](@ref Semigroups.reduce),
[`contains`](@ref Semigroups.contains),
[`currently_contains`](@ref Semigroups.currently_contains),
[`add_generating_pair!`](@ref Semigroups.add_generating_pair!),
[`partition`](@ref Semigroups.partition)) work on `Kambites` objects.

# Structural deviations from `KnuthBendix` / `ToddCoxeter` precedent

- `Base.length` is intentionally **not** defined for `Kambites`. The
  number of classes is always
  [`POSITIVE_INFINITY`](@ref Semigroups.POSITIVE_INFINITY) (or throws),
  so an alias would silently misbehave with `for i in 1:length(k)`.
  Use [`number_of_classes`](@ref Semigroups.number_of_classes)
  explicitly.
- [`non_trivial_classes`](@ref Semigroups.non_trivial_classes)`(k1::Kambites, k2::Kambites)`
  throws `ArgumentError` (upstream rationale: both `Kambites` instances
  always represent infinite-class congruences, so the construction does
  not generalize; cf. `kambites-helpers.hpp:128-133`).
- [`normal_forms`](@ref Semigroups.normal_forms)`(k::Kambites)` (no-arg)
  throws `ArgumentError` because the underlying normal-form range is
  infinite. Use the bounded form `normal_forms(k, n)` to materialize
  the first `n` normal forms.
- The `ukkonen()` accessor (and the `Ukkonen` type) is deferred to a
  later release

    Kambites(kind::congruence_kind, p::Presentation) -> Kambites

Construct a [`Kambites`](@ref Semigroups.Kambites) instance representing
a congruence of kind `kind` over the semigroup or monoid defined by the
presentation `p`.

`Kambites` instances can only be used to compute two-sided congruences,
so `kind` must always be [`twosided`](@ref Semigroups.twosided). The
parameter is included for uniformity of interface with
[`KnuthBendix`](@ref Semigroups.KnuthBendix), `ToddCoxeter`, and
`Congruence`.

This Julia wrapper builds a default `Kambites` and then calls
[`init!`](@ref Semigroups.init!) so that exceptions raised by
libsemigroups surface as
[`LibsemigroupsError`](@ref Semigroups.LibsemigroupsError) (the direct
CxxWrap-bound constructor would surface them as `Base.ErrorException`).

Re-initialize `k` so that it is in the state it would have been in
immediately after the corresponding constructor.

The one-argument form puts `k` back into the same state as a newly
default-constructed [`Kambites`](@ref Semigroups.Kambites).

The three-argument form puts `k` back into the state it would have been
in if it had just been newly constructed from `kind` and `p`.

    small_overlap_class(k::Kambites) -> UInt64

Get the small overlap class of the [`Presentation`](@ref
Semigroups.Presentation) underlying `k`.

If ``S`` is a finitely presented semigroup with generating set ``A``,
then a word ``w`` over ``A`` is a *piece* if ``w`` occurs as a factor
in at least two of the relations defining ``S``, or if it occurs as a
factor of one relation in two different positions (possibly
overlapping). A finitely presented semigroup ``S`` satisfies the
condition ``C(n)`` for a positive integer ``n`` if the minimum number
of pieces in any factorisation of a word occurring as the left or
right hand side of a relation is at least ``n``.

This function returns the greatest positive integer `n` such that the
finitely presented semigroup represented by `k` satisfies the
condition ``C(n)``, or
[`POSITIVE_INFINITY`](@ref Semigroups.POSITIVE_INFINITY) if no word
occurring in a relation can be written as a product of pieces. It may
trigger computation.

The return type is `UInt64` (rather than `Int`) because
[`POSITIVE_INFINITY`](@ref Semigroups.POSITIVE_INFINITY) is encoded as
`typemax(UInt64) - 1` on the wire and would not round-trip through
`Int`. Use [`is_positive_infinity`](@ref Semigroups.is_positive_infinity)
(or direct comparison `result == POSITIVE_INFINITY`) to detect the
infinite case.

Complexity: ``O(m^3)``, where ``m`` is the sum of the lengths of the
words occurring in the relations of the semigroup.
