## What is [libsemigroups][]?

Before explaining what `Semigroups.jl` is, it is first necessary to explain
[libsemigroups][]. [libsemigroups][] is a C++17 library containing
implementations of several algorithms for computing finite, and finitely
presented, semigroups and monoids. The main algorithms implemented in
[libsemigroups][] are:

- the [Froidure-Pin algorithm][] for computing semigroups and monoids defined
  by a generating set consisting of elements whose multiplication and equality
  is decidable (such as transformations, partial permutations, permutations,
  bipartitions, and matrices over a semiring);
- Kambites' algorithm for solving the word problem in small overlap monoids
  from ["Small overlap monoids I: The word problem"][], and the algorithm from
  ["An explicit algorithm for normal forms in small overlap monoids"][];
- the [Knuth-Bendix algorithm][] for finitely presented semigroups and monoids;
- a version of Sims' low index subgroup algorithm for computing congruences of a
  semigroup or monoid from
  ["Computing finite index congruences of finitely presented semigroups and monoids"][];
- a generalized version of the algorithms described in
  ["Green's equivalences in finite semigroups of binary relations"][] by
  Konieczny, and
  ["On the determination of Green's relations in finite transformation semigroups"][]
  by Lallement and Mcfadden for computing finite semigroups and monoids
  admitting a pair of actions with particular properties;
- the algorithm from
  ["Efficient Testing of Equivalence of Words in a Free Idempotent Semigroup"][]
  by Radoszewski and Rytter;
- a non-random version of the [Schreier-Sims algorithm][] for permutation groups;
- a version of Stephen's procedure from
  ["Applications of automata theory to presentations of monoids and inverse monoids"][]
  for finitely presented inverse semigroups and monoids;
- the [Todd-Coxeter algorithm][] for finitely presented semigroups and monoids;
  see also ["The Todd-Coxeter algorithm for semigroups and monoids"][].

[libsemigroups][] is partly based on
[Algorithms for computing finite semigroups][Froidure-Pin algorithm],
[Expository Slides][], and [Semigroupe 2.01][] by [Jean-Eric Pin][].

## What is `Semigroups.jl`?

`Semigroups.jl` is a package for Julia 1.9+ exposing much (but not all) of
the functionality of [libsemigroups][]. It is built with the help of the
excellent library [CxxWrap.jl][], for which we are very grateful.

The development version of `Semigroups.jl` is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/libsemigroups/Semigroups.jl), and some related
projects are [here](https://github.com/libsemigroups).
